## My story

### Chapter 1: Origin

Hi, I'm Alex. Born in the heart of **Rome** to a French mother and an Italian father, I was lucky enough to soak up a blend of cultures right from the get-go. Rome, with its timeless beauty and chaotic streets, was my playground, my school and my home for the first 25 years of my life.

During my teenage years, I dove into the world of **event organizing**. This wasn't just a job; it was a masterclass in understanding people. It taught me how to navigate through a sea of personalities, creating memorable experiences and forging many friendships.

The summer I turned 18 was a game changer. I became a **sailing instructor**, swapping bustling city life for the unpredictable calm of the sea. It was here, between the waves, that I truly understood the weight of responsibility. My crew and passengers depended on me not just for a good time, but for their safety. Facing stressful situations head-on, I learned the art of **maintaining composure and calmness under pressure**, a trait that would shape how I tackle life's challenges.

By 25, a couple of years after finishing my **university business degree**, I couldn't ignore the feeling inside me any longer. Rome, as much as I adored it, had become too familiar. It was like looking into the eyes of a beautiful and lifelong love and realizing the spark had dimmed. It was time for a new adventure, time to immerse myself in new cultures and experiences leaving my nest.

I retreated to my home in southern Italy, dedicating a few years to studying **computer science**. Then came a chance to move to **Vienna**, a city that stole my heart and captivated me with its charm almost instantly, and it's here that I've made my new home.. for now\..

### Chapter 2: Passions

Growing up, **curiosity** was one of my biggest and constant companion, always driving me to dive deeper into the subjects I encountered.

My dream job then was to soar the skies as an airline pilot. My **fascination with aviation** remains the same, finding the sight of a metal tube ascending into the skies is both inspiring and thrilling.

Beyond our atmosphere, **space** has captivated my imagination with its infinite vastness and its mysteries. The sheer scale of the universe prompts me to wonder about humanity's place in it 1000 years from now, fueling a passion for the exploration beyond our world.

**Music** is another key interest of mine—I can't envision living without melodies accompanying each moment.

As for **physical activities**, my experiments have been varied: from football to CrossFit, sailing to scuba diving, skiing to ping pong, bowling to MMA, and many more I've forgotten. Following the wisdom of a notable Latin poet, \*"Mens sana in corpore sano" \*, engaging in sports has fostered a healthy competitive spirit in me, always fueling my ambition to excel and improve, and to create a healthy and powerful body.

### Chapter 3: Inspirations

My path has been shaped significantly by my parents. My **father**, a highly motivated and skillful business and strategy consultant, and my **mother**, a tough and resilient entrepreneur, have both sparked my ambition to one day venture into entrepreneurship and create value for people and businesses.

**Steve Jobs** has always been a major source of inspiration for me, particularly his unparalleled storytelling skills that could almost bend reality. This phenomenon was so unique it was named the "Reality Distortion Field" – quite fascinating, and a testament to his ability to persuade and inspire those around him in extraordinary ways. What truly set Jobs apart was his visionary approach, blending technology with artistry to create products that weren't just tools but an integral part of users' lives, shaping the future of entire industries.

**Richard Branson**, too, has left a mark on my aspirations. His knack for launching exciting ventures across diverse industries, and consistently achieving remarkable outcomes, showcases his extraordinary leadership and ability to generate value. What sets Branson apart is his adventurous spirit, turning every business venture into an exciting journey, which aligns perfectly with my own entrepreneurial dreams.
