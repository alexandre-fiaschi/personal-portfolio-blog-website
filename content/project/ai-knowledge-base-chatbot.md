title: AI Knowledge Base ChatBot
description: >-
  I developed an AI Knowledge Base ChatBot to enhance the accuracy and
  reliability of AI-generated responses using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  (RAG) technique. A knowledge base chatbot is designed to answer user queries
  by accessing a repository of information, ensuring precise and contextually
  relevant responses. This project integrates a vector database to fetch
  pertinent information, thereby improving the performance of the generative AI
  model. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and utilizing the Langchain
  framework, the app leverages Supabase as a vector database. The user-friendly
  interface was inspired by an online course mockup.
