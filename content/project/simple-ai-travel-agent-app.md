title: Simple AI Travel Agent App
description: >-
  I developed a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS app for learning and exploring with AI
  Agents. The app leverages OpenAI GPT3.5 LLM model and the beta runTools
  function to execute the agent loop and run various tools available to the
  agent. These tools include access to weather APIs to provide users with
  real-time weather information and at the moment it dynamically generates
  (hallucinate) flights and hotels coherent with the user input query. The
  user-friendly interface was inspired by a mockup from an online course.
