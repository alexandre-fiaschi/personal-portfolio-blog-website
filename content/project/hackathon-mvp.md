title: Hackathon MVP
description: "As the Product Manager for our hackathon team, I had the incredible opportunity to lead the development of an innovative solution for Billa, a leading retail chain. Our challenge was to enhance the in-store shopping experience by integrating new features into the existing Billa app.  Our solution focused on two key areas:  \t1.\tIn-Store Navigation: We developed a feature that allows customers to efficiently find items on their shopping list by creating an optimal route within the store. This not only saves time but also enhances the overall shopping experience. \t2.\tDigital Shopping Assistant: This feature acts like a personal chef, providing recipe recommendations based on the customerâ€™s preferences and dietary needs. It integrates seamlessly with the in-store navigation, ensuring that customers can easily find the ingredients they need.  Our project aims to make grocery shopping more efficient and enjoyable, addressing key pain points such as time and effort while also increasing customer satisfaction and engagement."
